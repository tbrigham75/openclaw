Fred spin up our coder and have him use the cloud llm to do this task:
Fred, I want to build an Obsidian memory system into OpenClaw. Here's how it will work:
There are 4 layers, from smallest/always-present to largest/on-demand:
LAYER 1: BUILT-IN MEMORY (~2,200 chars) - Already implemented via MEMORY.md and daily logs in memory/
----------------------------------------

    Injected into every single prompt automatically
    Tiny — just compact facts and pointers
    Things like "Alex's name", "SSH into DGX with ssh spark", "vault is at X path"
    Think of it as sticky notes on my monitor — always visible

LAYER 2: AGENTS.md + SOUL.md - Already implemented via SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md
-----------------------------

    Also injected every single prompt automatically
    My operating instructions, personality, and hard rules
    Includes the mandatory logging rules we just tightened
    This is my "how to behave" layer

LAYER 3: OBSIDIAN VAULT (the big one)
--------------------------------------

    Obsidian is installed locally.  Find it, create a vault, and shared it with OpenClaw
    NOT auto-injected — I read it on session start and during work
    folders:

        Agent-Shared/ — both agents read/write
        user-profile.md — who you are, preferences, corrections
        project-state.md — all projects and their status
        decisions-log.md — shared decision history
        Agent-Hermes/ — my private workspace
        working-context.md — what I'm actively doing right now
        mistakes.md — things I've gotten wrong
        daily/ — daily logs (one file per day)
        Agent-OpenClaw/ — OpenClaw's space (I don't touch it)

    I READ on: session start, after compaction, when I need details
    I WRITE on: task start, every 3-5 tool calls, task completion, corrections

LAYER 4: SESSION SEARCH - Already available via memory_search and sessions_history
------------------------

    Searchable archive of every past conversation
    I don't write to it — it's automatic
    I query it when you reference past work or I need cross-session context
    Last resort recall — "what did we do about X last week?"

THE FLOW
========
New session starts
|
v
Read vault (user-profile, project-state, working-context, today's log)
|
v
Work on tasks — checkpoint to vault every 3-5 tool calls
|
v
Task done — append to daily log, update working-context
|
v
Compaction hits? — todo list survives, re-read vault after
|
v
Session ends — flush everything to daily log
